# geoffsee/di-framework

A lightweight, type-safe Dependency Injection framework for TypeScript using decorators. This framework automatically manages service instantiation, dependency resolution, and lifecycle management.

## Features

- **Zero Dependencies**: No external dependencies required. Works with SWC and TypeScript's native decorator support.
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with type inference for all injected dependencies.
- **Automatic Resolution**: Dependencies are automatically resolved and injected.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Built-in support for singleton and transient service lifecycles.
- **Factory Functions**: Register services using factory functions for complex initialization.
- **Telemetry**: Built-in support for method tracking and monitoring with `@Telemetry` and `@TelemetryListener`.
- **Error Detection**: Detects circular dependencies and unregistered services at runtime.
- **Testing Support**: Easy to test with mock service registration.

## Why Use This Framework?

Traditional dependency injection requires manual service instantiation and wiring, which becomes error-prone and difficult to maintain as your application grows. This framework eliminates that complexity:

**Without DI Framework:**
```typescript
const createServerContext = (env, ctx) => {
  if(!instanceState.member) {
    const contextInstance = Context.create({
      contactService: ContactService.create({}),
      assetService: AssetService.create({}),
      transactionService: TransactionService.create({}),
      // ... 20+ more services manually created and wired
    });
    instanceState.member = contextInstance;
  }
  
  instanceState.member.setEnv(env);
  instanceState.member.setCtx(ctx);
  // ... manual dependency wiring
  return instanceState.member;
};
```

**With DI Framework:**
```typescript
@Container()
export class ApplicationContext {
  constructor(
    @Component(ContactService) private contactService: ContactService,
    @Component(AssetService) private assetService: AssetService,
    @Component(TransactionService) private transactionService: TransactionService,
    // ... all services automatically injected
  ) {}
}

// Usage
const container = useContainer();
const appContext = container.resolve(ApplicationContext);
```

**Benefits:**
- No manual service instantiation
- No manual dependency wiring
- Automatic singleton management
- Type-safe dependency resolution
- Easier to test (mock services simply by registering test implementations)
- Scales better as services grow

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { Container, Component } from 'di-framework/decorators';
import { useContainer } from 'di-framework/container';

// Define a service
@Container()
export class DatabaseService {
  connect(): void {
    console.log('Connected to database');
  }
}

// Use it in another service
@Container()
export class UserService {
  @Component(DatabaseService)
  private db!: DatabaseService;

  getUser(id: string) {
    return this.db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${id}'`);
  }
}

// Resolve and use
const container = useContainer();
const userService = container.resolve<UserService>(UserService);
userService.getUser('123');
```
